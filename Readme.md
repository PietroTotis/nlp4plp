# nlp4plp

This project contains the solver for the [nlp4plp project](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/natural_language).
The solver code was developed by [Angelika Kimmig](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/634329-kimmig-angelika).

## Compressed

Where the data is stored.
Future work: fix predicates in the solver in order to get back to the original representation.

## Experiments

A collection of examples and tests for critical (slow) problems, some contain representations of the corresponding grounding and smaller (tractable) versions. Can be ignored.

## Run

The run folder contains some scripts that can be used in order to run the solver. Further description of how to use them is contained in the folder.

## Solver

The Prolog files of the solver.

## nlp4plp examples.xlsx

Contains some statistics of past issues, tests, and summaries of the data.
